            <p>The concept was simple yet ambitious: to create a turn-based RPG with strategic
                depth and immersive narrative. The heart of any RPG, of course, is its battle system. This was where I decided to
                start, diving deep into the mechanics that would drive player engagement and challenge.

                    <h2>Crafting the Battle System</h2>
                        <p> The turn-based battle system is a hallmark of classic RPGs. It's a dance of strategy, where every move counts, and
                            players must think several steps ahead. My vision was to recreate the traditional system from scratch to experience the
                            development process firsthand.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image">
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Character Stats:</strong> Characters in the game were designed with physical and magic abilities. This
                        ensured that players had to think critically about which ability to use in different scenarios, adding a layer of
                        strategy to each encounter.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptive AI:</strong> The enemies weren't pushovers. I made sure to make them select options based on the
                        current situation in battle. Reacting to the players health and physical stats as the battle progressed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>The Visual Hurdle</h2>
            <p>While the mechanics of the battle system were coming together, there was a significant challenge looming overhead:
                the lack of a concrete visual structure. Visuals are the soul of a game, providing the first impression and
                continuously shaping the player's experience. Without a clear visual blueprint, developing the game became akin to
                navigating a maze blindfolded.
            </p>

            <ul>

                <p>The absence of a structured visual design meant:</p>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent Art Styles:</strong> Different elements of the game seemed disjointed, as there was no unified
                    art direction guiding their creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Development Delays:</strong> While there was no deadline for this personal project, every change or addition
                    required extra time to ensure it visually aligned with existing elements, slowing down the overall development
                    process.</li>
                <li><strong>Gameplay Confusion:</strong> Without clear visuals, it became challenging to communicate gameplay
                    mechanics to the players effectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>While the game remains unfinished, the journey was far from a wasted effort. It taught me the invaluable lesson of
                the importance of a clear visual structure in game development. A cohesive visual design not only enhances the
                player's experience but also streamlines the development process, providing a clear roadmap for the team.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In the future, I'm determined to approach game development with a more holistic view, ensuring that both mechanics
                and visuals are given equal importance from the outset.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Every challenge faced is a lesson learned. Embrace the journey,
                for it is filled with opportunities for growth and innovation.

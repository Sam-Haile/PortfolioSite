                    <p>In this conceptual project, our team embarked on the journey of creating an
                        interactive gaming experience, through the use of augmented reality (AR) to redefine user
                        engagement and immersion.

                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p> Our AR game was designed to push the boundaries of virtual interaction,
                        creating a space where <strong>digital</strong> and <strong>physical</strong> space can work
                        together seamlessly. We worked to create an experience where players can interact with the
                        game universe as naturally as they would with the physical world around them.
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Role: UX Researcher</h2>
                    <p>One of my key responsibilities was conducting comprehensive user surveys. These surveys were
                        crucial in capturing insights about how users perceive and interact with AR technology as well
                        as the genre of cooking simulators.</p>

                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <p>
                        The outcome of our AR gaming project showcased my ability to effectively translate user
                        data into actionable design insights. I was able to contribute significantly to a project that,
                        though hypothetical, demonstrated a deep understanding of user needs in an emerging technology
                        space.

                        of expertise with AR technology and cooking influence their engagement with our game.
                        Additionally, I aimed to gauge the
                        balance between educational and entertainment value in the game, and how this impacts user
                        satisfaction and long-term

                        <h2>
                            Most users expected some form of microgame to be present.</h2>
                        <p>To identify user expectations, I asked users to tell me what they envisioned this game should
                            be
                            like. A significant number of users expressed their <strong>expectations for the
                                implementation
                                of mini-games</strong>, associating the
                            cooking genre with more interactive, gamified elements. This feedback highlighted a
                            disconnect
                            between our initial
                            concept and user assumptions.</p>

                        <h2>Users preferred a casual gaming experience.</h2>
                        <p>User surveys revealed a <strong>preference for a more casual gaming environment</strong>,
                            contrasting with our initial direction
                            towards competitive gaming. This forced the team and I to take a step back and reassess our
                            design strategy,
                            focusing on creating a more relaxed and user-friendly experience that aligns with the
                            audience's
                            preferences. </p>

                    <h2>1. Balancing Realism with Engagement:</h2>
                    <p>To address this challenge, I reconvened with the team and we concluded that the optimal approach
                        would be to find a
                        middle ground between our original concept and the users' expectations. This involved
                        incorporating more gamified
                        elements into the realistic cooking environment we had envisioned.</p>

                    <p>Ultimately, this strategic compromise led to the
                        creation of a blueprint for a more engaging user experience, one that maintained the
                        authenticity of a cooking
                        simulator while enhancing its appeal through interactive gaming features. </p>

                                In response to the insights gained from user surveys, I collaborated with the team to
                                shift our focus from a competitive
                                gameplay model to a more casual and relaxed one. This pivot meant reimagining our game
                                to better suit the preferences
                                for a laid-back, enjoyable experience, leading us to design a framework that emphasized
                                ease of play and user enjoyment,
                                while moving away from the high-stakes competitive elements initially planned.

                    <h1>What I've Learned</h1>
                    <p>I greatly enjoyed this project and learned a lot about how the user influences product
                        development.</p>

                    <h3><strong>1. The importance of user-centric design.</strong></h3>
                    <p>I believe what makes a product effective is being able to find that balance between my
                        creative vision and the
                        user's expectations. By conducting user surveys and interviews, I was better able to align the
                        objective of the project with
                        the actual needs and preferences of our target audience. This is crucial in ensuring that the
                        product not only fulfills its
                        intended purpose but also resonates deeply with users.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h3><strong>2. Embracing the iterative nature of design.</strong></h3>
                    <p>The design process is iterative and ongoing, especially in game development when adapting to
                        rapidly changing
                        technology trends and user preferences. Continuous testing and feedback are vital to refine the
                        product and keep it
                        aligned with user needs, ensuring that the game not only meets but anticipates the evolving
                        expectations and
                        experiences of its audience.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3><strong>3. Balancing entertainment and utility.</strong></h3>
                    <p>For a game like this, with practical applications, striking the right balance between
                        entertainment and providing potential educational value is a delicate and important aspect of
                        design. This equilibrium is
                        essential to ensure that while the game remains fun and engaging, it also effectively imparts
                        useful skills and
                        knowledge, thereby enhancing the overall value and appeal of the user experience.

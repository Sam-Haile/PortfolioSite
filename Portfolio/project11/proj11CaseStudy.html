                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p> The objective of this project study was to create a board game from initial concept to
                        final product over a semester. This case study will focuses on the detailed process of bringing
                        an initial idea to life through stages
                        of ideation, iterative design, user testing, and final production. This journey highlights how
                        the game not only
                        provides entertainment but also integrates advanced design principles and user experience
                        insights.
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Role: Lead Designer</h2>
                    <p>As the Lead Designer of this project, my role was pivotal in steering the board game's
                        development from its
                        conception to fruition. My responsibilities were twofold, encompassing both project leadership
                        and hands-on UX
                        design.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <p>
                        The board game project was a resounding success, exceeding our initial expectations in both
                        player engagement and design
                        efficacy. This achievement is a testament to the effective application of UX principles,
                        resulting in a product that is
                        not only enjoyable but also user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

                        <p> This board game project was initiated for two purposes: to innovate within the real of
                            tabletop games, and to
                            explore how UX principles can be effectively applies in a non-digital medium. To kick off
                            the project, I collaborated
                            with four other students to determine our key focus areas:

                    <h1>Research Methods</h1>
                    <h2>Playtesting</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the development of the board game, I conducted several iterations of playtesting, each
                        designed to assess and enhance player interaction and comprehension.</p>

                    <p>In light of the game's dual-role structure, where players assume either a murderer or a
                        detective, I implemented
                        targeted surveys for each role. This approach ensured that the feedback gathered was
                        role-specific and
                        relevant, allowing me to fine tune the game experience to suit each unique perspective.</p>

                        <h1>Defining the Problem</h1>
                        <h2>Insights</h2>
                        <p>After our first round of playtesting, I collected the results and regrouped with my team. I
                            was able to deduce
                            trends and draw insights from the surveys. Heres some of the key insights included listed
                            below.</p>

                        <h2>Users felt the game was too long.</h2>
                        <p>Players consistently reported that the game's duration was excessively long, diminishing the
                            overall enjoyment. The
                            structure of the game led to all clue cards being collected before reaching the midpoint,
                            disrupting the pace and
                            tension crucial to the experience. </p>

                        <h2>Clue and evidence card timing was too late.</h2>
                        <p>Feedback highlighted a significant issue with the timing of evidence cards' introduction into
                            gameplay. Their late
                            appearance often left players unable to solve the case, leading to frustration and a sense
                            of unfulfillment.</p>

                        <h2>Murderer's role was inefficient</h2>
                        <p>A notable concern was the limited active engagement of the player in the murderer role. The
                            current game design
                            restricts the murderer's actions due to high point requirements for activities, leading to a
                            less enjoyable
                            experience.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section id="section1c">
                    <h1>Design</h1>
                    
                    <p>We clearly had our work cut out for us. The goals was to now brainstorm solutions about how to
                        remove the lack of
                        engagement both parties felt. I also recieved feedback from my professor before moving on to
                        drafting some enhancments.</p>
                        
                    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Phase 1: Addressing Initial Playtest Feedback.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Early Introduction of Evidence Cards:</strong> To avoid the issue of players being unable
                        to solve the case due to late
                        presentation of evidence cards, I adjusted the game mechanics to introduce these cards earlier.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Clarifying Game Rules and Objectives:</strong> I revised the game's instructions and
                        rulebook to clearly state the hidden role
                        of the murderer, the significance of red spots for movement, and procedural details like the
                        order of play and the
                        collaborative nature of investigators.</p>

                    <p><strong>Improving Clue Relevance and Distribution:</strong> Realizing that clues were too vague
                        and were all picked
                        up too quickly, I rebalanced the number and nature of clues and red herrings to ensure a more challenging and
                        engaging deduction
                        process.</p>
                        
                    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Phase 2: Enhancing the Role of the Murderer.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Empowering the Murderer:</strong> Feedback indicated the murderer's role was too passive. I addressed this by
                        reducing the points required for actions, enabling more dynamic and strategic play for this role.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Reconfiguring the Map:</strong> Noting that the murderer was confined to a small section, I reconfigured the game map
                            to allow greater mobility and interaction possibilities for the murderer.

                                <p> The initial version showcases our starting point - a basic layout where the foundational ideas were
                                    first conceptualized. The final version, on the other hand, shows the power of an iterative design process,
                                    reflecting the integration of user feedback, refined mechanics, and enhanced aesthetics.</p>

                    <h1>What I've Learned</h1>
                    <p>I greatly enjoyed this project and learned a lot about how the user influences product
                        development.</p>

                    <h3><strong>1. The Value of Iterative Design and User Feedback in Game Development.</strong></h3>
                    <p>This project vividly illustrates the importance of iterative design in the realm of game development, especially in a
                        non-digital medium like board games. My role as the Lead Designer in facilitating multiple rounds of playtesting,
                        analyzing feedback, and then implementing changes based on that feedback, really drove home the value of iterative design.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h3><strong>2. Balancing Game Mechanics for Varied Player Roles.</strong></h3>
                    <p>My focus on creating a balanced experience for different player roles – investigators and murderers – was a vital lesson
                        in UX design for games. The initial feedback about the murderer's role being too passive and the subsequent
                        modifications to empower this role highlight the necessity of considering all user perspectives in design. This
                        approach ensures that each player, regardless of their role, has a fulfilling and engaging experience.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3><strong>3. Adapting UX Principles to Non-Digital Mediums.</strong></h3>
                    <p>The project's success in integrating UX principles into a board game showcases the
                        adaptability and broad applicability of UX design principles beyond a digital space. My efforts in
                        understanding and accommodating varied player demographics, focusing on social interaction, and ensuring the game’s
                        appeal and accessibility taught me a lot.
